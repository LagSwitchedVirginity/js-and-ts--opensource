    - A way to get a random item from a nested object
        - [Item that isn't a object](random really cool stuff/get random item from nested object or array.js)
            - Usages:
                1. `<func>(obj)`
                2. `<func>(obj,levelGoal)`
            - Explanation of usage #b
                - If level reached = level specified, return random from that level
                - If level = non object/array item, return that level-item
